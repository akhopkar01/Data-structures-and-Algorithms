# About the Repo
This Repository consists of all the exercises in Data Structures and Algorithm Udacity nanodegree program. Before seeing the results, I encourage you try the problems yourself for the nanodegree program.

## Exercises
These exercise form the in-session practice questions of the course. You can find the source code for the exercises in /Exercises.

### Python Refresher - Common Data Structures in Python
Under this section, The test cases for each problem statement is explicitly mentioned in the code. I solved the following problems:
- Problem 1: Control Structures
  - For a given linear data structure (array), find the smallest positive number. For eg., array = [3,4,6,1,2,-7,-2] the output should be 1.
  - Given a directory detail regarding the semester and the offered courses and the course, return a list containing all the semesters offering the given course. 
- Problem 2: Functions and Generators
  - Make use of Generator to find a running factorial of given number. For eg., if number entered by the user is 3, the expect output is: 1, 2, 6
  - Using function, check if the sudoku matrix is correct or not. The validity of the sudoku matrix can be found by checking if two conditions apply: 
    * The row must contain all the numbers from 1 to n just once.
    * The column of the matrix must contain all the number from 1 to n just once.
- Problem 3: Birthday tracking System using OOP
  - Given a list of people with their ages and corresponding birthday months, return a dictionary of all the people who have their birthdays in april with their names as the key and their incremented age to show how old they turn as the value.
  - Find out the most common month people have their birthdays in. 

### Data Structures
This section includes data structures such as Arrays & Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Hash Maps etc. and can be accessed ```cd ~/Data-structures-and-Algorithms/Data-Structures/```
#### Arrays and Linked List
This section includes how to create a linked list and doubly linked list and perform some basic operations such as Insert, Append, Remove, Search, pop etc. The file SinglyLinkedList.py can be imported to get the operations of linked list in your program. The files can be accessed in the folder /Arrays&LinkedLists
